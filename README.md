# Data Science Portfolio

Hello!  This repository contains a selection of my favorite personal projects that I've worked on.  Each project is written in Python using Jupyter Notebooks for easy viewability.  

If you like what you see here and want to know more about a particular project, chat about a work opportunity, or collaborate on something in the future, reach out to me at [rbush1127@gmail.com](rbush1127@gmail.com).

Enjoy!
