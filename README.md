## [Forecasting the Price of Bitcoin with Prophet](https://github.com/rbush1127/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Time%20Series%20Analysis/BTC_Forecast.ipynb)
Inspired by the work of a mysterious Twitter Bitcoin investor, I decided to see how accurately $BTC could be modeled as a simple time series, and then extended the analysis to include trading volume as an exogenous variable.  I use the Yahoo Finance Python API to load the data, pandas for dataset management, SciKit-Learn for preprocessing and hyperparameter selection, and Facebook's Prophet package to forecast the price into the future.
