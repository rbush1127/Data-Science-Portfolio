## [Forecasting the Price of Bitcoin with Prophet](https://github.com/rbush1127/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Time%20Series%20Analysis/BTC_Forecast.ipynb)
Inspired by the work of a mysterious Twitter Bitcoin investor, I decided to see how well the price of Bitcoin could be forecasted as a simple time series, and then extended the analysis by including trading volume as an exogenous variable.  The file uses the Yahoo Finance Python API to load the dataset, pandas for dataset management, SciKit-Learn for preprocessing and hyperparameter selection, and Facebook's Prophet package to forecast the price into the future.
